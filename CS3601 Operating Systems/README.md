# SJTU CS3601 Operating Systems

The instructor of this course is Jinyu Gu, a very kind and enthusiastic lecturer. His lectures equipped me with basic concepts and principles of a usable operating system. My notes (which also serves as a cheat sheet), my solutions to ChCore-Lab, and lecture slides are provided in this folder.
