# SJTU CS3611 Computer Networks.

The instructor is Haiming Jin, a young & kind professor and an expert in this area. You will surely learn a lot about computer networks in his lectures.

The `ComputerNetworks.pdf` contains the notes I took during his courses. It was edited using Markdown (source `.md` file together with images given in folder `notes`).

`cheat_sheet.pdf` is my cheat sheet for his final exam. To be frank my cheat sheet helped little, so I didn't get ideal grade in exam. It is expected that students who take his exam should review ***all his PPTs*** before taking the exam, and your cheat sheet had better contain much more details than mine. The student might take this document as a brief summary of knowledge points instead of a cheat sheet!

You are likely to find whatever you need to complete his written assignments as well as all labs on github, so I'm not providing my solutions.
