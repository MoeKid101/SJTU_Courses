# SJTU EV904 Global Change: Nature and Ecosystem

From my perspective, this course embodies the essence of the general education. The instructor Shan Yin, is adept at navigating student's awareness to his topics, capturing their attention, and aligning these efforts with his educational objectives. In this course, I'm taught significantly more than ecology. The instructor has imparted to us multiple perspectives on viewing the relationships between nature and human, which deeply influenced my worldview.

Consequently, in this course essay I have done extensive search in the environmental effect of data centers, based on which this survey is presented.
