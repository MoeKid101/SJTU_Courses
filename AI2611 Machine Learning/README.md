# SJTU AI2611 Machine Learning

The instructor is Bingbing Ni.

This directory provides:

- The class project: implementation of Support Vector Machine.

    `SVM_Report.pdf` file is my report, offering mathemtical principles as well as experimental results. As required by instructor, I tested my code on MNIST and CIFAR-10 (without feature extraction).

    `SVM_code` folder contains the python codes of my implementation as well as scripts as an example of using the code. The implementation follows the *SMO* algorithm in Platt's paper. The folder `code/data` is left intentionally empty, and when you run "code/script.py" the script would automatically download MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset into that folder.

- The cheat sheet `cheat_sheet.pdf` for the final exam. This cheat sheet won't help much. You ***should*** test yourself on the final exams of past years. For students taking AI2611, my humble opinion is that it matters more to master ML itself than to obtain a high score in the exam. Having GPA affected due to absenteeism is very unpleasant, especially considering that the teacher had initially stated no points would be deducted for absence.

- `notes.pdf`: my notes of Stanford cs229. I prefer Andrew Ng's teaching style which benefited me a lot.

- Project of **Practical Implementation of Machine Learning Engineering**: another course instructed by the same professor intended to provide practical experience to students. The final report and the requirements document are listed in this folder. This work was done in cooperation with Jiude Wei and Yuying Zhang. I have enjoyed the process of cooperating and tackling a realistic ML engineering problem with you two!
