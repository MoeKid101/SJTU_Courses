# SJTU AI3610 Brain-Inspired Intelligence (Causal Inference)

It is exactly the causal inference part of this course that excites me most. Lectured by Nanyang Ye, the creative and visionary researcher, we students are exposed to the highly captivating theory of causal inference. My notes (still unfinished), the textbook and lecture slides are provided in this folder.

In addition, the final project of this course is aimed at solving **OoD generalization** utilizing the model of causal inference. Specifically, the dataset is **Colored-MNIST**, a simple dataset which calls for robust and insightful algorithms instead of complex training techniques. This work is done under cooperation with Runkun Chen and Haoyu Zheng. I have enjoyed the process of cooperation.
